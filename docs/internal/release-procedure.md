# Release Procedure

The ["trunk-based" development strategy](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) is used for releases of Arduino IDE. A branch named `<major>.<minor>.x` (where `<major>.<minor>` is the major and minor version numbers), is created for each minor version series. Release tags (both pre-release and production) are created from these branches. This allows a release to be created from a select subset of the commits in the `main` branch, [cherry-picked](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) to the release branch.

## Steps

The following are the steps to follow to make a release of Arduino IDE:

### 1. üó∫Ô∏è Merge localization sync PR

A pull request titled "**Update translation files**" is submitted periodically by the "**github-actions**" bot to pull in the localization data from [**Transifex**](https://www.transifex.com/arduino-1/ide2/dashboard/).

If there is an open PR, this must be merged before making the release.

It will be shown in these search results:

https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/pulls/app%2Fgithub-actions

### 2. üõ†Ô∏è Check bundled tool versions

The Arduino IDE release includes several tool dependencies. Unstable versions of these tools may be pinned provisionally for use with the development version of Arduino IDE, but production releases of Arduino IDE must use production releases of the tool dependencies.

The tool versions are defined in the `arduino` object of [`arduino-ide-extension/package.json`](../../arduino-ide-extension/package.json).

If any of the tools are pinned to a development version, ensure a suitable production release of the tool is available and then submit a PR to update the version in `arduino-ide-extension/package.json`.

### 3. üëÄ Check version of packages

The [`version` field](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#version) of the project's `package.json` metadata files received a patch version bump (e.g., `2.0.1` -> `2.0.2`) at the time of the previous release.

If this is a patch release, the current metadata values are correct and no action is needed.

The changes contained in this release might be considered to change the project's "API". If so, a patch version bump will not be appropriate and the version must be adjusted in compliance with the [**Semantic Versioning Specification**](https://semver.org/).

Follow the instructions for updating the version metadata [**here**](#update-version-metadata).

#### Examples

If the version number of the previous release was `2.0.1`:

- If this is considered a minor release (non-breaking changes to the "API"), the `version` values must be changed to `2.1.0`.
- If this is considered a major release (breaking changes to the "API"), the `version` values must be changed to `3.0.0`.

### 4. üçí Prepare release branch

#### Create

A new release branch must be created on every minor version bump. For example, if you are making the `2.2.0` release, then it is necessary to create a branch named `2.2.x`. That branch will be used for all subsequent releases in the `2.2` minor version series (e.g., `2.2.1`, `2.2.2`).

#### Update

Push all commits that are to be included in the release to the release branch. This can be a [cherry-picked](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) subset of the commits from the `main` branch if not all the work from `main` is ready for release.

### 5. ‚úÖ Validate release

#### Evaluate CI status

The checks run by the continuous integration system might provide an indication of a problem that should block the release. Since the code in the release branch doesn't necessarily match to that of the `main` branch, it is essential to check the status of the release branch even when everything is passing in the `main` branch.

1. Open the following URL in your browser:<br />
   https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/actions
1. Type `branch:<release branch>` (where `<release branch>` is the name of the release branch for this release) in the "**Filter workflow runs**" field of the "**Actions**" page.
1. Press the <kbd>**Enter**</kbd> key.
1. Wait for all in progress workflow runs to finish.
1. Click on the first workflow name on the list at the left side of the page.
1. Check the status of the latest run. If it was not successful, investigate the cause and determine if it is of significance to the release.
1. Repeat the above steps for each of the listed workflows.

#### Beta testing

The "**Arduino IDE**" workflow run that was triggered by the branch creation will contain artifacts that can be used for beta testing.

[More information about beta testing](../contributor-guide/beta-testing.md)

### 6. üö¢ Create the release on GitHub

Then, you need to **create and push the new tag** and wait for the release to appear on [the "**Releases**" page](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/releases).

‚ö† Doing this will create a new release and users who already have the IDE installed will be notified from the automatic updater that a new version is available. Do not push the tag if you don't want that.

1. Checkout the release branch in the repository.
1. Run the following commands:
   ```text
   git pull
   git tag -a <YOUR_VERSION> -m "<YOUR_VERSION>"
   git push origin <YOUR_VERSION>
   ```

Pushing a tag will trigger a **GitHub Actions** workflow on the `main` branch. Check the "**Arduino IDE**" workflow and see that everything goes right. If the workflow succeeds, a new release will be created automatically and you should see it on the ["**Releases**"](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/releases) page.

### 7. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Bump version metadata of packages

In order for the version number of the tester and nightly builds to have correct precedence compared to the release version, the `version` field of the project's `package.json` files must be given a patch version bump (e.g., `2.0.1` -> `2.0.2`) **after** the creation of the release tag.

Follow the instructions for updating the version metadata [**here**](#update-version-metadata).

### 8. üìÑ Create the changelog

**Create GitHub issues for the known issues** that we haven't solved in the current release:

https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/issues

From the ["**Releases**"](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/releases) page, edit the release notes following the **Keep A Changelog** scheme:

https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/#how

Add a list of mentions of GitHub users who contributed to the release in any of the following ways (ask @per1234):

- Submitted a PR that was merged
- Made a valuable review of a PR
- Submitted an issue that was resolved
- Provided valuable assistance with the investigation of an issue that was resolved

Add a "**Known Issues**" section at the bottom of the changelog.

### 9. ‚úé Update the "**Software**" Page

Open a PR on the [bcmi-labs/wiki-content](https://github.com/bcmi-labs/wiki-content) repository to update the links and texts.

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you don't have access to the repo, ask in the `#team_wedo` **Slack** channel.

**‚ùó Make sure all the links to the new IDE build are working.**<br />
If they aren't, there has probably been some issue with [the "**Arduino IDE**" workflow run](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/actions/workflows/build.yml) triggered when pushing the tag during the "**Create the release on GitHub**" step of the release procedure.

Ask for a review of the PR and merge it.

Follow the ["**Production (subset of https://arduino.cc)**" instructions](https://github.com/bcmi-labs/wiki-content#production-subset-of-httpsarduinocc) in the `bcmi-labs/wiki-content` repository readme to deploy the updated "**Software**" page content.

When the deploy workflow is done, check if links on the "**Software**" page are working:

https://www.arduino.cc/en/software#future-version-of-the-arduino-ide

### 10. üòé Brag about it

- Ask in the `#product_releases` **Slack** channel to write a post for the social media and, if needed, a blog post.
- Post a message on the forum (ask @per1234).<br />
  Example: https://forum.arduino.cc/t/arduino-ide-2-0-0-rc9-3-available-for-download/1028858/4
- Write a message in the `#general` **Slack** channel:

## Operations

The following are detailed descriptions of operations performed during the release process:

<a id="update-version-metadata"></a>

### ‚öô Update version metadata of packages

You need to **set the new version in all the `package.json` files** across the app (`./package.json`, `./arduino-ide-extension/package.json`, and `./electron-app/package.json`), create a PR, and merge it on the `main` branch.

To do so, you can make use of the `update:version` script.

For example, if you want to update the version to `<YOUR_VERSION>`, you should run the following commands:

```text
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b version-<YOUR_VERSION>
yarn update:version <YOUR_VERSION>
git commit -am <YOUR_VERSION>
git push origin version-<YOUR_VERSION>
```

replacing `<YOUR_VERSION>` with the version you want. Then create a PR and merge it.
